                <p class="text-small"> Have you ever tasted Chicken tikka at an Indian restaurant and instantly fell in
                    love, but you have always been told that Indian cooking is difficult? <br />

                    <br />

                    Fret not, because on this website I will explain how to prepare simple Indian meals. We'll start
                    with the basics and work our way up to the point where you feel comfortable adding a pinch of this
                    and a dash of that. Through this series, I hope you'll be able to realise that once you grasp the
                    essentials, everything else should be easy. And maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to dispel the
                    misconception that Indian cooking is inherently difficult at that point. Once more, you heard
                    correctlyâ€”a myth!
